# Static Site Generator

## Guided Project with [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python)

This project takes markdown formatted text and generates an html version. The page should be running at [sbrown3212.github.io/static_site_generator](https://sbrown3212.github.io/static_site_generator) Currently, the content on the page comes from boot.dev, but in the future, I may personalize it to be content of my choice.

<!-- ## What I learned -->

<!-- Python os package -->
<!-- Python unit testing -->
<!-- More exposure to OOP -->
